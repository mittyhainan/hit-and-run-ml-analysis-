    " The most common reason for contact with the police is being a driver in a traffic stop. There are many factors that play a role in this process: age, gender, race, etc. By our common sense, young adults and males are more likely to commit traffic violations and be pulled over consequently. By reading daily news we understand the police brutality against people of color, especially African American. For example, by the report from Guardian, black people in California are far more likely to be stopped than other racial groups. We find it interesting and reflecting to analyze the underlying factors that might play a role in determining whether people will be stopped by law enforcement.\n",
